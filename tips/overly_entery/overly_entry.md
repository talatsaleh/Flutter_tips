## 🔍 What is an `Overlay`?
An `Overlay` is a special widget in Flutter that allows you to display widgets on top of everything else in your app — above the normal widget tree.
- It's like a transparent "canvas" floating above your screen.
- Used for things like modals, tooltips, dropdowns, or context menus.
- Every MaterialApp or Navigator already comes with an Overlay built in.
Think of it Like this:
> 🪟 Your normal app is a page on the screen. The Overlay is like a piece of glass you can draw over the top of the whole page.

## 🧩 What is an `OverlayEntry`?

An `OverlayEntry` is a widget you add to the Overlay. It’s just like a "layer" that sits above the UI.
You creat it Like it:
``` dart
  OverlayEntry myOverlay = OverlayEntry(
  builder: (context) => MyFloatingWidget(),
    );
```
And then show it using:
``` dart
 Overlay.of(context).insert(myOverlay);
```
Or remove it using:
``` dart
myOverlay.remove();
```

## 🔗 What is `LayerLink`?
A `LayerLink` is a class used to "connect" two widgets across layers (like a hook 🪝).
You use it with:
- `CompositedTransformTarget`: the widget you want to attach things to, like a target 🎯
- `CompositedTransformFollower`: the widget that will follow the target like a hook🪝
The 2 widgets must share the same 🔗 `LayerLink` instance.
## 🐟 What is `CompositedTransformTarget`?
This widget marks a position in your UI — like a GPS beacon — for another widget to follow like a fish 🐟, where a hook 🪝 will hook it and be linked to a fishing pole 🪵 stick.
It looks like this:
```dart
  CompositedTransformTarget(
  link: _layerLink,
  child: MyButton(),
);
```
It doesn’t do anything visible — acts as an anchor point for the follower, or as said, as a target 🐟.

---

## 🪝 What is `CompositedTransformFollower`?
This widget is placed in an `Overlay`, and it will follow the 🎯 `CompositedTransformTarget` — staying glued to its position.
it looks like this:
```dart
CompositedTransformFollower(
  link: _layerLink,
  offset: Offset(0, 50), // offset below the target
  child: MyDropdownMenu(),
  );
```
Even if the screen scrolls or resizes, it will stay in the correct position.

---
## 🧠 How They Work Together (Mental Model)?
Think of them like 🎣 Fishing Pole:
- `CompositedTransformTarget` is the target 🎯 or the fish 🐟 where you want to hook 🪝 it by a 🔗 `LinkLayer`.
- `CompositedTransformFollower` is the hook 🪝 where follow the target 🎯 or fish 🐟 by 🔗 `LinkLayer`.
- `LayerLink` is the Link 🔗 between 🎯 target and 🪝 hook.
So if the target 🎯changed position, it will always 🪝 hook with it and will appear, above everything else, with it by `OverlayEntry`.

---

## 🔁 Full Lifecycle Flow
1. The `Widget` is wrapped in `CompositedTransformTarget` with `LayerLink`.
2. When tapped, it creates an `OverlayEntry` using `CompositedTransformFollower`.
3. That follower stays positioned relative to the `Widget`, even if the layout changes.
4. It will remove the overly when it's done by `remove()`.
