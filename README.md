# 📘 Flutter Learning Notes

This repository is my personal documentation of Flutter tips, tricks, patterns, and bugs I've solved during development. I created it so I can easily revisit solutions and insights in the future.

## 📚 Index
1. [The Usage of `OvelayEntry` to Create Custom DropDownMenu or Button](tips/overly_entery/overly_entry.md)

## 📌 Usage

Any time I learn something worth revisiting, I’ll add a new file inside `tips/` and update this index.
